            TaJ Built in 1903, the Taj Mahal Palace is Mumbaiâ€™s first harbor landmark,
            the site of the first licensed bar in the city (the Harbour Bar, which still stands) and
            the first hotel in India to have steam elevators.
            <br /><br />
            The Taj is renowned across the world for its vast elegance, impeccable service and sheer
            magnitude: It has 560 rooms, 44 suites and 1,500 staff, including 35 butlers.
            <br /><br />
            Despite being the site of a deadly terrorist attack in 2008, the hotel remains popular
            among tourists and celebrities alike: President Barack Obama reportedly rented out the
            entire property during his 2010 visit.
            <br/><br/>
            Embark on a journey of exquisite experiences for the discerning connoisseur, 
            seamlessly woven together with impeccable service, sophisticated ambience and masterful 
            culinary artistry.</p>
